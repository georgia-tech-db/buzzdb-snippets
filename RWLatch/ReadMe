This script is created to implement read-write latch. 
read_lock, write_lock, read_unlock, write_unlock in rwlatch.hpp deals with lock/unlock using conditional variables and mutex.
The strategy used here prioritizes reading over writing. Readers may starve writers under this implementation.
rwlatch.cpp tests the program. To serve as a tutorial, we print out all intermediate statuses.
